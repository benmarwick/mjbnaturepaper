This document the code to reproduce the figures in the main paper that I'm involved in.

## Extended Data Figure 4

The artefacts occur in three dense bands. Detailed piece plotting revealed three dense bands of artefacts at the site with less dense bands of artefacts in between. 

Each band corresponds to a change in raw material use and stone working technology. 

```{r}
# section scatter plot, artefacts in all squares
plot_stone_artefacts(stone_artefacts_only)

# section scatter plot, just artefacts in B and C
stone_artefacts_only_B_C <- stone_artefacts_only[grep("B|C", stone_artefacts_only$square), ]
plot_stone_artefacts(stone_artefacts_only_B_C)

# vertical bar plot of raw materials and technology, B6 only
spit_depths_B6_output <- spit_depths_B6(points_in_main_excavation_area)

B6_raw_materials <- readr::read_csv("data/stone_artefact_data/B6_raw_material_table.csv")

plot_raw_materials_technology <- 
raw_materials_technology_plots(B6_raw_materials, spit_depths_B6_output)

# chi-sq for raw material by phase
chi_sq_raw_material_by_phase_tbl <- chi_sq_raw_material_by_phase(plot_raw_materials_technology)

chisq.test(chi_sq_raw_material_by_phase_tbl)


# These plots are arranged in inkscape to create the final figure EDF-4

```


## Extended Data Figure 8

Associations were found between 19 artefacts (lower = 17, middle = 2) indicating refits and conjoins within the lower two dense artefact layers but not between them. Although artefacts increase in mass slightly with depth overall, change in depth explains only 0.20% of changes in artefact mass. If we look into the upper and lower bands of artefacts separately, we see that ...  


```{r}
# Refits -------------------------------------

# plot refit plan and section views, and rose plot of dip
# check aspect ratio of these plots
refit_output <- refits(stone_artefacts_only)

# median distance between refitting artefact fragments
median_refit_dist <- 
median(refit_output$refit_data_coords_wide$refit_dists_m)
 <- 
mad(refit_output$refit_data_coords_wide$refit_dists_m)


# Vertical distance between refitted pieces
refit_vertical_dist_median <- 
median(abs(with(refit_output$refit_data_coords_wide, Elevation.x  -  Elevation.y)))

refit_vertical_dist_mad <- 
mad(abs(with(refit_output$refit_data_coords_wide, Elevation.x  -  Elevation.y)))
mad_refit_dist
# Size sorting ---------------------------------------------

# size sorting plot with smoother
size_sorting_plot(spit_depths_B6_output)

```




## Extended Data Figure 9

Each pulse in artifact discard corresponds to a peak in mass-normalized magnetic susceptibility, increasing in magnitude towards the surface, and a peak in the quantity of burnt chert in the lower two bands (chert is absent in the upper band), indicating artifact pulses are probably associated with phases of intense anthropogenic burning in the shelter 

```{r}
prepared_geoarchaeology_data <-  
  prepare_geoarchaeology_data(cleaned_rotated_points_in_main_excavation_area)

# grain size and cluster plot is separate
plot_granulometry_data(prepared_geoarchaeology_data)

plot_geoarchaeology_data(prepared_geoarchaeology_data)

# import PDFs into EDF SVG and resize to fit

```


## Extended Data Figure 10

Micromorphology of the excavated deposits shows aeolian and alluvial origins of predominantly lightly clay-coated rounded quartz grains, with less-weathered disaggregation and slow exfoliation from the rockshelter wall sandstone 

## Extended Data Figure XX

depth age and age of each artefact band, as well as first occupation

```{r}
c14_ages <- get_c14_ages(cleaned_rotated_points_in_main_excavation_area)
osl_ages <- get_osl_ages(cleaned_rotated_points_in_main_excavation_area)

plot_ages_and_artefacts(osl_ages, c14_ages, stone_artefacts_only)
```


 
## Extended Data Table 1

Raw materials are predominantly quartzite, silcrete, exotic fine-grained quartzite, mudstone and dolerite (Extended Data Table 1)
